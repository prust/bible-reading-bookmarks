# Bible Reading Bookmarks

*Generate bible reading plan bookmarks based on a starting date &amp; book/chapter.*

There are <a href="http://thebibleteam.com/PlanMaker.asp">many</a> <a href="http://khornberg.github.io/bible-reading-planner/">existing</a> bible reading plan generators -- 
    the one at <a href="https://www.biblereadingplangenerator.com/">biblereadingplangenerator.com</a> in particular has many powerful features.

However, there are some features I wanted that I didn't see in an existing generator:
* Modern, compact bookmark formatting
* Plan more or fewer chapters on weekends
* Easily regenerate the plan starting at the chapter you're on (if you get behind)
